# tasm_progs
This reopsitory containts programs I've written for the dos operating system using TASM. They were probably (as of writing, all of them) were written for school.

## the projects
### asmcalc
asmcalc is a console calculator, very limited that can only take positive values up to 65535 (2^16 -1) and display very high values (caluclations don't always work bc I suck).
It can do powers, factorials, and even square roots (no decimal points tho).

### piano
a full graphical piano with only the basic notes. (could use some tuning). it loads a bmp picture as a starting screen, which was a real pain.

### game_demo
a demo for a game, where you control a green dot with WASD and blue walls block you so you can't move through them.
